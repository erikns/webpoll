# Contributing

Contributing to this project is subject to a few rules and a simple process for
facilitating collaboration and review.

## For core developers

If you have direct push-access to the repository, the commits should be made
directly. However, please create a separate feature branch for each incremental
improvement. Then open a pull request between your feature branch and the
master branch. The pull request and feature branch provide a nice sandbox for
testing and review before final merging into master.

When naming your feature branch, please use a name that describes your change
in as few words as possible, and prefix the branch name with your GitHub
username. Ex: `erikns-add-contrib-docs`

## For external contributors

If you are external to the core team and would like to make contributions,
please fork the repository, make the changes in your own fork and submit a pull
request.
